# Powerbi-Healthcare-Dashboard
Power BI analysis of healthcare access and funding efficiency in Africa.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare infrastructure, funding distribution, and service efficiency across various African regions using Power BI. The goal is to uncover disparities between urban and rural areas, evaluate how funding translates into healthcare outcomes, and provide actionable insights to policymakers.

##  Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query (ETL/Data Cleaning)  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Data Modeling & Relationships  
- Custom Measures & Conditional Columns  
- Interactive Data Visualization  

---

##  Dataset Summary
The dataset includes information on:
- Healthcare facility types (Clinics, Hospitals, Health Centers)
- Geographic location (Urban vs. Rural)
- Funding received (USD)
- Annual patient visits
- Emergency response times
- Electricity and internet availability
- Healthcare workforce (Doctors and Nurses)

---

##  Key Calculated Columns & Metrics
- **Urban vs. Rural Classification:** Based on funding thresholds  
- **Funding Level Classification:** Low (<$45K), Medium (<$80K), High (≥$80K)  
- **Funding Efficiency:** `Funding Received / Annual Patient Visits`  
- **Availability Type:** Combined electricity and internet access classification  
- **Response Time (mins):** For each facility type  
- **Patient Satisfaction Rate** and other high-level KPIs

##  Key Visuals & Insights
### 1. **Facility Distribution: Urban vs. Rural**
- Urban areas have slightly more facilities across all types.
- This highlights a potential gap in advanced care access for rural populations.

### 2. **Funding Allocation**
- Urban: 53.3%  
- Rural: 46.7%  
- Despite near parity, rural areas face greater infrastructure and staffing challenges.

### 3. **Emergency Response vs. Funding**
- Clinics respond fastest despite lower funding.
- Hospitals have more funding but longer response times.
- Suggests operational inefficiencies in larger facilities.

### 4. **Funding Efficiency by Facility Type**
- **Clinics**: Most efficient – highest patient volume per dollar spent.  
- **Hospitals**: Least efficient – serve fewer patients with more funding.  
- Points to better scalability of smaller clinics in rural areas.

### 5. **Infrastructure Gaps**
- Some regions lack both electricity and internet (e.g., Eastern Rwanda).
- Limits potential for digital health services and emergency care coordination.

---

##  Actionable Recommendations
- **Invest in rural clinics**: Cost-effective and fast responders.
- **Improve emergency logistics**: More funding alone doesn't improve response times.
- **Bridge infrastructure gaps**: Electricity + internet crucial for modern healthcare.
- **Offer incentives to healthcare workers** in rural areas to reduce staffing gaps.

##  Project Outcome
This dashboard offers a clear, data-driven view into how healthcare resources are distributed and used. It supports strategic decision-making to improve healthcare access and outcomes across under-resourced regions.
